Exercise 8.4
Predicting house prices: a regression example* — Get this code to run and then answer the following questions.

1. What good did the K-fold validation do in this exercise?

    ANSWER:
        It provided a more reliable metric for evaluating the model by training four, similar models separately and
        returning the average of the validation scores of the four models.

2. Chollet claims that it would be problematic to use data values with “wildly different ranges”. Why is this?

    ANSWER:
        Variables with larger ranges will have more influence on the outcome than variables with smaller ranges. This
        decreases the accuracy of the model.

3. Chollet also claims that smaller datasets “prefer” smaller networks. Do you agree? Explain your answer.

    ANSWER:
        As we increase the size of the network, we increase its ability to recognize particular properties the data.
        For small datasets, this causes overfitting and negatively affects the generality of the model.

4. Try networks with one more and one less hidden layer, and wider or narrower layers. Do any of your alternatives do
better than the suggested architecture? Why or why not?

    ANSWER:
        The model with one more hidden level performed slightly better (MAE decreased from 2.5 to 2.4) than the suggested
        architecture. The model with wider layers performed slightly worse (MAE increased from 2.5 to 2.6) than the
        suggested architecture.
