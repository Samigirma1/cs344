Exercise 10.4
ML Practicum: Image Classification — Do the first exercise included in this tutorial.

Questions:

Exercise 1:
a. What’s the size/shape of the cats/dogs datasets?

    ANSWER: 1,000 training, 500 testing images for both cats and dogs.

b. How does the first CNN compare with the one we did in class.
c. Can you see any interesting patterns in the intermediate representations?

    ANSWER:
        1. The convolution looks cyclical. The images go between high contrast images that resemble the original image
           and images that look like original image if we had applied an edge filter on it.

        2. The modules seem to favor edge features in the images. Most of the images look like the edges on the animals
         in the original image.

        3. There are som "dark spots" in the images. It's curious how filters that get those tensors are able to generate
         the "edge-filter" images.
