Exercise 10.3
Classifying Handwritten Digits with Neural Networks

Questions:

Task 1: What does the confusion matrix show for this example?

    ANSWER: It shows the number of examples mis categorized by the model. For the MNIST, it would be the digits confused
        for some value other than their real value. From the matrix, we can see that most of the hand-written numbers
        were labelled correctly. However, we can also see digits like 4 and 9, and 8 and 5 are confused for one-another.

Task 2: How does the TensorFlow network architecture differ from the Keras example given in class? Report any
improvements you can make over the baseline testset accuracy for this task.

    ANSWER: The Architecture used in the exercise is a dense network with 2 hidden layers with 100 units. The example
        from class was a CNN with 2 convolution modules and one hidden layer with 64 units.

Task 3: What differences can you see between the visualizations for 10 steps and 1000 steps?

    ANSWER: Some if the pictures in the visualization for 1000 steps show some level of structure. I can almost see some
        patterns that resemble hand-written digits. The visualizations for 10 steps was just static noise.
