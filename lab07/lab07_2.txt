Exercise 7.2
First Steps with Tensor Flow.

Questions:

a. Compare and contrast categorical vs numerical data

ANSWER:
    Categorical data is represented by a finite set of labels (categories), while numerical data is data represented in
    numerical values.

b. Submit solutions to tasks 1–2. Include your best hyper-parameter values and the resulting RMSE, but not the training
   output.

    Task 1: Achieve an RMSE of 180 or Below

    ANSWER:
        train_model(
            learning_rate=0.00002,
            steps=1000,
            batch_size=10
        )
        RESULTING RMSE: 169.34

    Task 2: Try a different feature

    ANSWER:
        train_model(
            learning_rate=0.000025,
            steps=1000,
            batch_size=20,
            input_feature = "population"
        )
        RESULTING RMSE: 176.25

c. What are the hyper-parameters learned in these exercises and is there a “standard” tuning algorithm for them? Explain
   your answer.

   ANSWER:
    The hyper parameters are the learning rate, steps, and batch size.
