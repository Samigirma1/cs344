Exercise 7.2
First Steps with Tensor Flow.

Questions:

a. Compare and contrast categorical vs numerical data

ANSWER:
    Categorical data is represented by a finite set of labels (categories), while numerical data is data represented in
    numerical values.

b. Submit solutions to tasks 1–2. Include your best hyper-parameter values and the resulting RMSE, but not the training
   output.

    Task 1: Achieve an RMSE of 180 or Below

    ANSWER:
        train_model(
            learning_rate=0.00002,
            steps=1000,
            batch_size=10
        )
        RESULTING RMSE: 169.34

    Task 2: Try a different feature

    ANSWER:
        train_model(
            learning_rate=0.000025,
            steps=1000,
            batch_size=20,
            input_feature = "population"
        )
        RESULTING RMSE: 176.25

c. What are the hyper-parameters learned in these exercises and is there a “standard” tuning algorithm for them? Explain
   your answer.

   ANSWER:
    The hyper parameters are the learning rate, steps, and the batch size. The learning rate determines the size of the
    gradient step. The steps determine the number of steps the model explores/ The batch size determines the size of
    data chunks (created by dividing the original data) used to train subsequent epochs.

    The way a model is tuned is very data-dependent. So, there is no tuning algorithm. However, the standard practice
    for tuning the model is to increase the steps until the training converges. If it converges too slowly, we can
    increase the learning rate. If the training error varies wildly, we should decrease the learning rate, increase
    training steps, or increase the batch size.
