Exercise 7.3
Synthetic features and Outliers

Questions:

b. Submit solutions to tasks 1â€“3.

    Task 1: Try a synthetic feature:
    In the cell below, create a feature called rooms_per_person, and use that as the input_feature to train_model().

    ANSWER:
        california_housing_dataframe["rooms_per_person"] =
            california_housing_dataframe["total_rooms"] / california_housing_dataframe["population"]
        calibration_data = train_model(
            learning_rate=0.00005,
            steps=500,
            batch_size=5,
            input_feature="rooms_per_person"
        )

    Task 2: Identify outliers
    Use Pyplot's scatter() to create a scatter plot of predictions vs. targets, using the rooms-per-person model you
    trained in Task 1.

    ANSWER:
        plt.scatter(calibration_data["predictions"], calibration_data["targets"])

    Task 3: Clip Outliers
    See if you can further improve the model fit by setting the outlier values of rooms_per_person to some reasonable
    minimum or maximum.

    ANSWER:
        california_housing_dataframe["rooms_per_person"] =
            california_housing_dataframe["rooms_per_person"].apply(lambda x: x if x < 5 else 0)

        equivalently,

        california_housing_dataframe["rooms_per_person"] =
            california_housing_dataframe["rooms_per_person"].apply(lambda x: x if x < 5 else 5)

b. What is the purpose of introducing synthetic features?

    ANSWER:
        Synthetic features improve the predictions of our models by providing a feature (made by combining other features)
        that better represents complex relationships between features and targets. For example, in the case of the
        california housing data, the median value of a house depend more on the block density than population count or
        number of rooms. So, using the "bock density" synthetic feature in our model will give us better predictions
        than using either number of rooms or the number of people.

c. What are outliers and what is typically done with them?

   ANSWER:
    Outliers are exceptional values that don't represent the rest of the data. Since having those data values skews the
    predictions of the models, the values are adjusted to either the maximum or the minimum of the rest of the data-values.
