First-Order Logic â€” Homework 5
1. Do exercise 7.2 in the text. Do your work on paper and then speculate on whether you could program the solution in
   Prolog (easily)? Explain why or why not?

   ANSWER:

   Rules.
   isMythical => isImmortal
   !isMythical => !isImmortal && isMammal
   isImmortal || isMammal => isHorned
   isHorned => isMagical

   -- Inference --
   !isMythical => !isImmortal && isMammal = (!isMythical => !isImmortal) && (!isMythical => isMammal)
      -> Since !isMythical => !isImmortal (which is equivalent to isImmortal => isMythical),
             and isMythical => isImmortal are true, isMythical = isImmortal
      -> Since isMythical = isisImmortal and (!isMythical => isMammal) = (!isImmortal => isMammal) = (isImmortal || isMammal)
      -> Since isImmortal || isMammal is true, isHorned is also true.
      -> Since isHorned is true, isMagical is also true.

   So, the unicorn is horned and magical.

Do LPN! exercise 2.4 (i.e., the crossword problem).
