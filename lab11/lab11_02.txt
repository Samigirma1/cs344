Exercise 11.2
Intro to ML Fairness

Questions:

Task #1 — What are the biases present in the given dataset?

    Answer:
        - white majority, (80% + )
        - the majority don't have investments (90%+ have 0 capital gain)
        - there are twice as many men as women
        - majority has low income (<= 50 K)


Task #2 — Assess the potential bias in some other feature besides education level.

    Answer: Looking at income bucket, we see that the gender ratio for incomes less than 50K is about the same as the
        gender ratio for the general population. However, the gender ratio for incomes above 50K are around 84 men to
        women. This shows that women who earn higher than 50K may be underrepresented.

Task #3 — Do as written.

Task #4 — Do you find disparities when you look at race rather than gender? If so, which way to they skew?

    Answer: It is skewed to "White" (which has Precision of 0.70 and Recall of 0.6, while "Black" has Precision
          of 0.65 and Recall of 0.4702).
