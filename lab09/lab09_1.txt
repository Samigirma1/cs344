Exercise 9.1
Logistic Regression

Questions:

1. How effective is the linear regression approach to the problem?

    ANSWER: The linear regression approach was not effective. It had a a high error rate and
        even made impossible predictions (probabilities greater than 1).

2. Task 1: Compare and contrast L2 Loss vs LogLoss.

    ANSWER: L2 Loss measures loss by using the square of the diff between the observations and predictions. So, the loss
        value does not effectively express the difference between probabilities or the gravity of "false certainty" in
        for binary classification problems.
        LogLoss measures loss by using the a Cross-entropy function. So, incorrect classifications made with high certainty
        (high probabilities) will have much higher loss values that incorrect classifications made with low certainty.
        This makes LogLoss a better measure for calculating loss in probability/classification problems.

3. Task 2: Explain how effective logistic regression is compared with linear regression.

    ANSWER: Since we're using Logloss, the loss values were higher than the loss values for the linear regression
        approach. However, the logistic regression model did not overfit (validation and training losses were about the
        same) as much as the linear regression model.

4. Task 3: Here, just report the best values you can achieve for AUC/accuracy and what hyperparameters you used to
   get them.

    ANSWER:
        Learning Rate  = 0.000006
        Steps          = 25000
        batch_size     = 300
        ------------------------
        Accuracy       = 0.78
        AUC validation = 0.81
